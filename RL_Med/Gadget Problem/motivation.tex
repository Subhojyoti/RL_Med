Some of the difficult features that constitute the medical domain are 

\begin{itemize}
\item The medical environment is a Partially Observed MDP (POMDP). At any instant
\item Long horizon problem where you only receive the feedback at the end of the episode. In the medical domain this is encountered because only after several days once the patient is discharged a feedback is received.
\item Time constrained episodes, such that reaching the terminal get well state after a fixed time is redundant as death would have occurred.
\item Time varying rewards
\end{itemize}
