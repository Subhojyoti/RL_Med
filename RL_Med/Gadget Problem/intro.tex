In this report we build a gadget world  for the Reinforcement Learning (RL) setup for the medical domain. A gadget problem is a simple environment which captures some of the complexities of the real-world domain which we are trying  to model. We can test various RL algorithms in this gadget worlds before transitioning to the real-world higher complexity environments. The hypothesis behind creating such gadget worlds is that if an RL algorithms performs poorly in this small gadget world, it will surely perform poorly in real-world domains.
