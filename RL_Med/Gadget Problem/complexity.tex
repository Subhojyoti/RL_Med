Some of the difficult features that constitute the medical domain which we try to model in this gadget world are :-

\begin{itemize}
\item The medical environment is a partially observed environment. At any instant the physician is only exposed to some of the factors influencing the health of the patient.
\item Long horizon problem where you only receive the feedback at the end of the episode or the feedbacks are very sparse in nature.
\item Time constrained treatment, which requires that the effective treatment needs to be delivered within a fixed time otherwise it may result in death.
\item Time varying adversarial feedbacks, which may be encountered in sudden spikes in responses from the patient to the treatments administered.
\end{itemize}
