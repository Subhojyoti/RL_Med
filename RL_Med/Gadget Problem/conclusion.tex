In this report we formulated two gadget domains which are easy to handle and yet has sufficient complexities to handle many important and intriguing features of the real-life medical domain. We also showed that both Q-Learning and Sarsa with linear approximation fails to perform well in these domains. Future work includes proposing new algorithm that might perform better in these environments or to test planning algorithms in these domains.
