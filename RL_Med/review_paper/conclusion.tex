In this report we reviewed some of the papers applying reinforcement learning techniques to medical domains. We discussed how RL algorithms are extremely important in modeling medical test-cases. We also describes general settings for the RL algorithm and some pf the challenges the this sequential tasks faces in real-life medical test-cases. Then we discussed in detail several important papers which have proposed some of the seminal RL algorithms in medical settings. Finally we came up with some gadget problems which are easy to handle and yet has sufficient complexities to handle many important and intriguing features of the real-life medical domain. We also showed that both Q-Learning and Sarsa with linear approximation fails to perform well in these domains. Future work includes proposing new algorithm that might perform better in these environments or to test planning algorithms in these domains.
