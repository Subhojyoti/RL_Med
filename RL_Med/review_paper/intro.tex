Machine Learning algorithms have come to dominate several applications in our day-to-day life like  recommender systems, managing industrial workforce, game-playing, etc. Simultaneously, in the health-care domain as well the machine learning algorithms have found increasing applications in recommending and improving treatment policies for ailing patients. Among the various  available approaches within the machine learning framework we specifically discuss about Reinforcement learning (RL) in this report. RL is a sub-field of Machine Learning which has many useful applications in medical domain but simultaneously also faces many challenges as we will discuss in this report. 


%seems to be limited by various challenges. In this report we discuss several of these challenges and what is the best way to tackle them.
